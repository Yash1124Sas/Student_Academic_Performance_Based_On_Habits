# Student_Academic_Performance_Based_On_Habits
"Predicting Academic Performance Based on Student Habits Using Machine Learning":- The goal is to explore how different variables affect student performance in terms of exam scores. This project focuses to predict exam scores by using regression based machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost. Compare all models, and get one best model among them based on 'MAPE' score. After developing and implementing, we get linear regression model is best model among them. And last, i tried to deploy it, by using streamlit.
